Your support encourages us to continue developing and improving the model. Thank you for helping us grow!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Dataset 1 Folder**: Contains preprocessed data specific to the first IES dataset.
- **Dataset 2 Folder**: Contains preprocessed data specific to the second IES dataset.

These datasets were generated using **Apros**, a simulation tool for process systems. The repository includes only the processed data required for model training. Original raw data can be accessed at Zenodo: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14058544](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14058544).

## Publication

The detailed research paper describing this model, its architecture, and applications in IES will be provided here upon publication.
